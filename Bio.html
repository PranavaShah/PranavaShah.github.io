  <h3>It all started at UIUC...</h3>
    <p>
      Pranava (Pro) and Nishma met in undergrad. He was a little slow at realizing his true love was right under his nose and took him 4 years to figure that out. When his soul mate was starting Dental School at UMich, was when he realized he couldn't live without her. He worked in Iowa at the time and would drive 6 hours (one-way) to spend the weekend with her. It was a rough drive but always worth it at the end. Almost felt like a mini-vacation everytime. At some point Pro had a choice to move to Colorado. He enjoyed his process engineering job in a plant, but at the same time knew he had another calling. He ended up getting the job in Colorado, baught a house and was ready for his soon to be wife to join him there after Dental School. He proposed to Nishma right before her Dental School Graduation in Rocky Mountain National Park in a nice boutique hotel known as Dela Tera. Thank god they had a romance package. He popped the question and she said yes
      After she moved into the house with him, there was definitely a learning curve that came with it. But at the end it worked out great. After a few years we knew it was time to start a family. We also noticed we were taking a lot of trips back to Chicago (Wedding, Baby showers, etc). Both sets of parents were back in Chicagoland area so we thought, what better place to start a family. So Pro found ANOTHER job where he joined Kraft Foods while his wife, the dentist, joined a few practices. We lived in a very small 1 bedroom apartment in Evanston and eventually realized we needed to move. We ended up in Skokie. Well long story short, Pro and Nish's dreams came true and Sept 9. 2015, Zara Shah was born. She turned 5 month Feb 9, 2015 and cannot believe how much a baby can change from birth to now. The evolution process is just mind-blowing. I have been on paternity leave these last 2 months and it has been an absolute joy being able to spend this quality time with my little girl
      Going back to work will be hard, but it'll just make coming home that much sweeter.
