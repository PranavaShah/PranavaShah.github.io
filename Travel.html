        <h3>Cancun Le Blanc Resort & Spa</h3>
        <p>Cancun is an area that is composed of history, nightlife and peace and quiet depending on the resort you stay at. We stayed at a very small boutique resort for adults. This made the experience that much more serene because of the private beach, exellent food and other great inclusions for the price. The liquor being top shelf also helped. We even had our own butler! When we weren't lounging by the pool we were at the beach enjoying the calm waves. It was impossible to sleep in because the sunset was almost too perfect to miss. The other thing that we learned after the first day was to have dibs on a beach chair by the pool. People would put their towels there as early as they could get up so if you were a late comer you had slim picking for an ideal chair to relax and lounge. Overall this was one of our most relaxing and straight forward trips. We did not experience the night-life except when we were taking a 3 AM shuttle back back to the airport</P>

      <h3>Rome, Italy </h3>
      <p>.Italy by far was probably one of our best trips. We started in the Amalfi Coast where we swung by Capri and other small towns in the area. It is a beautiful, quaint town with lots of local foods and people. We had our first taste of gelato here and were hooked on gelato about twice a day. We then took a train to Rome, where we had a very quick stay to see all the attractions. The Vatican museum, Spanish steps, and many other great historical artifacts were observed on this leg of our trip. We were deeply immersed into a different vibe vs. Amalfi, but saw a common theme of amazing piazzas. After Rome was Florence. Amazing museums, alleys, shopping, and cathedrals were here. We rented a car to go to wine-country (Tuscany) where we stayed for a few nights in an old castle that had a Michelin Star Restaurant. We didn't know what/how to order since in Italy they have so many courses, but the price was so expensive at this restaurant we decided to limirourself.
      As a result the chef gave us a lot of complimentary food which we weren't expecting and ended up being a really funny story when we tell our friends how pathetic we were during this extremely delicious meal. We did our own wine tour and saw some amazing vineyards along with the wine-making process. Lots of samples later we made it back to our old castle to wind down. We eventually had to take the rental car back to Florence where we ended up getting a speeding ticket about 3 months after the trip was up. (Probably drove a little too fast) After we made it back to Florence we took another train to Venice. This was our last lef og the trip. From here there were a lot of water taxis and small alleys to get us to our hotel. It was a maze getting around Venice but it was a beautiful city. Obviously Shakespeare had a huge influence on the place and masks were everywhere. We then flew out of venice back home with the wonderful memories that will now last us a lifetime.</p>

        <h3>Athens, Greece</h3>
        <p>Greece is a magical place, assuming your luggage gets to the final destination. Our experiences regarding travel was very interesting and uneventful. 1. AliItalia is probably one of the poorest run airlines I've ever seen. 2. Athens is probably the least likely airport to get your luggage assuming you checked something in. Other than that, Greece is a beautiful country. We started our adventures in Crete, focused on the western side known has Chania (Pronounced Hania). We hiked 10 miles, ate great food, and went to a beach where the water was crystal clear and waist deep for 100+ yards out. Once I got my luggage (after wearing the same clothes for 3 days),  we headed to Santorini. Cannot describe the serenity we felt. This is the place to do nothing except relax with a good book. They have a beautiful sunset in Oia, we rented ATVs to do our own wine tour and visited the multi-sand beaches, with a lot of lounging by the inifinite pool
        At the end of this segment of the trip we hopped on a plane to spend our last night in Athens. Here we did what all tourists did - Acropolis. The history, vibe, classic beauty that these monuments brought was unbelievable. We did some more historic sightseeing, while my wife was done with seing any more statues of Greek Gods - this was when we had to bid farewell. At the end this trip was our last before the next adventure began - Parenthood!</p>
